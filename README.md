Let's build a web app to manage my X (formerly Twitter) posts.
Help me think through how to break this into iterative pieces and write a plan.md.

Requirements:

- Google OAuth or email auth to log in; no username/password. Ensure the DB schema handles this.
- Allow the user to connect their X account so they can manage posts.
- Use the X API to fetch post analytics/usage data and store it in the DB.
- Add unit tests for business logic and e2e tests for core user journeys.
- Use Git and pnpm with descriptive commit messages.

Design:

- Minimal, functional, practical
- Intentional use of color
- TRON tones
- Inspired by social apps

Frontend:

- Next.js and React
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui
- ESLint 9

Backend:

- Postgres
- Drizzle ORM
- Hono

Infra:

- GitHub
- Cloudflare
- Sentry

Check off items in the plan as we accomplish them (as a to-do list). If you have open questions that require my input, add those to the plan as well.
