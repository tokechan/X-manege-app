# X-manage-app Cursor Rules - Main Configuration

You are working on the X-manage-app project, a modern full-stack application for managing X (Twitter) posts with analytics.

## Project Overview

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Cloudflare Workers, Hono, Drizzle ORM
- **Database**: Turso (SQLite)
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library (web), Vitest (api)
- **Monorepo**: pnpm workspace

## Key Principles

1. **Test-Driven Development**: Always write tests for new features
2. **Type Safety**: Use TypeScript strict mode everywhere
3. **Code Quality**: Maintain high standards with automated checks
4. **Git Workflow**: Follow conventional commits and automated testing
5. **Performance**: Optimize for both development and production

## File Structure

```
X-manage-app/
├── apps/
│   ├── web/          # Next.js frontend
│   └── api/          # Cloudflare Workers API
├── drizzle/          # Database schema and migrations
├── scripts/          # Automation scripts
└── docs/            # Documentation
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create feature branch: `./scripts/test-workflow.sh git new feature/name`
2. Write tests first, then implement features
3. Run tests frequently: `pnpm test:watch`
4. Commit with conventional format: `./scripts/test-workflow.sh git commit "feat: message"`
5. Pre-commit hooks automatically run quality checks

## Code Standards

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error handling
- Add accessibility attributes
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Write self-documenting code with clear names
